                              label_transform=transforms.Compose([
                                  transforms.Select(['emotion']),
                                  transforms.Lambda(lambda x: x + 1)

                              online_transform=transforms.Compose([
                                  transforms.ToTensor(),

                              ]),
                              label_transform=transforms.Select(['emotion']))
        print(dataset[0])
        # EEG signal (torch.Tensor[62, 200]),

    An example dataset for GNN-based methods:

    .. code-block:: python
    
        dataset = SEEDIVDataset(io_path=f'./seed_iv',
                              root_path='./eeg_raw_data',
                              online_transform=transforms.Compose([
                                  ToG(SEED_IV_ADJACENCY_MATRIX)
                              ]),
                              label_transform=transforms.Select(['emotion']))
        print(dataset[0])
        # EEG signal (torch_geometric.data.Data),
        # coresponding baseline signal (torch_geometric.data.Data),
        # label (int)
        
    In particular, TorchEEG utilizes the producer-consumer model to allow multi-process data preprocessing. If your data preprocessing is time consuming, consider increasing :obj:`num_worker` for higher speedup. If running under Windows, please use the proper idiom in the main module:

    .. code-block:: python
    
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            dataset = SEEDIVDataset(io_path=f'./seed',
                              root_path='./eeg_raw_data',
                              online_transform=transforms.Compose([
                                  ToG(SEED_IV_ADJACENCY_MATRIX)
                              ]),
                              label_transform=transforms.Select(['emotion']),
                              num_worker=4)
            print(dataset[0])
            # EEG signal (torch_geometric.data.Data),
            # coresponding baseline signal (torch_geometric.data.Data),
            # label (int)

    Args:
        root_path (str): Downloaded data files in matlab (unzipped eeg_raw_data.zip) formats (default: :obj:`'./eeg_raw_data'`)
        chunk_size (int): Number of data points included in each EEG chunk as training or test samples. If set to -1, the EEG signal of a trial is used as a sample of a chunk. (default: :obj:`800`)
        overlap (int): The number of overlapping data points between different chunks when dividing EEG chunks. (default: :obj:`0`)
        num_channel (int): Number of channels used, of which the first 62 channels are EEG signals. (default: :obj:`62`)
        online_transform (Callable, optional): The transformation of the EEG signals and baseline EEG signals. The input is a :obj:`np.ndarray`, and the ouput is used as the first and second value of each element in the dataset. (default: :obj:`None`)
        offline_transform (Callable, optional): The usage is the same as :obj:`online_transform`, but executed before generating IO intermediate results. (default: :obj:`None`)
        label_transform (Callable, optional): The transformation of the label. The input is an information dictionary, and the ouput is used as the third value of each element in the dataset. (default: :obj:`None`)
        before_trial (Callable, optional): The hook performed on the trial to which the sample belongs. It is performed before the offline transformation and thus typically used to implement context-dependent sample transformations, such as moving averages, etc. The input of this hook function is a 2D EEG signal with shape (number of electrodes, number of data points), whose ideal output shape is also (number of electrodes, number of data points).
        after_trial (Callable, optional): The hook performed on the trial to which the sample belongs. It is performed after the offline transformation and thus typically used to implement context-dependent sample transformations, such as moving averages, etc. The input and output of this hook function should be a sequence of dictionaries representing a sequence of EEG samples. Each dictionary contains two key-value pairs, indexed by :obj:`eeg` (the EEG signal matrix) and :obj:`key` (the index in the database) respectively.
        io_path (str): The path to generated unified data IO, cached as an intermediate result. (default: :obj:`./io/seed`)
        io_size (int): Maximum size database may grow to; used to size the memory mapping. If database grows larger than ``map_size``, an exception will be raised and the user must close and reopen. (default: :obj:`10485760`)
        io_mode (str): Storage mode of EEG signal. When io_mode is set to :obj:`lmdb`, TorchEEG provides an efficient database (LMDB) for storing EEG signals. LMDB may not perform well on limited operating systems, where a file system based EEG signal storage is also provided. When io_mode is set to :obj:`pickle`, pickle-based persistence files are used. (default: :obj:`lmdb`)
        num_worker (str): How many subprocesses to use for data processing. (default: :obj:`0`)
        verbose (bool): Whether to display logs during processing, such as progress bars, etc. (default: :obj:`True`)
        in_memory (bool): Whether to load the entire dataset into memory. If :obj:`in_memory` is set to True, then the first time an EEG sample is read, the entire dataset is loaded into memory for subsequent retrieval. Otherwise, the dataset is stored on disk to avoid the out-of-memory problem. (default: :obj:`False`)
