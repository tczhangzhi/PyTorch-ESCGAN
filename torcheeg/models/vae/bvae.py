class BEncoder(nn.Module):
    r'''
    The variational autoencoder consists of two parts, an encoder, and a decoder. The encoder compresses the input into the latent space. The decoder receives as input the information sampled from the latent space and produces it as similar as possible to ground truth. The latent vector should approach the gaussian distribution supervised by KL divergence based on the variation trick. This class implement the encoder part.
